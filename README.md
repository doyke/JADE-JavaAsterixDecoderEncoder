ASTERIX is the EUROCONTROL Standard for the exchange of Surveillance related data.
ASTERIX provides a structured approach to a message format to be applied in the exchange of surveillance related information for various applications. Managed by the ASTERIX Maintenance Group (AMG) with its multinational participation, it ensures a common data representation, thereby facilitating the exchange of surveillance data in an international context.
ASTERIX also defines a structured approach to the encoding of surveillance data. Categories group the information related to a specific application. They consist of a number of data items which are defined in the ASTERIX documents down to the bit-level.
